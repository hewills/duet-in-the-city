Please note that some operating systems use case-sensitive paths. To avoid unnecessary hassle make sure that the path specifications you use in code matches that of your folders and files.

To create a .love-file you have to create a zip file of the whole game directory. Make sure that main.lua is in the root of the archive

   <somedir>\duet-in-the-city\audio\...
   <somedir>\duet-in-the-city\components\...
   etc...
   <somedir>\duet-in-the-city\main.lua
   <somedir>\duet-in-the-city\conf.lua
   
Once you have your zip file you simply rename the ending from .zip to .love and you are done!
