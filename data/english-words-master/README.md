english-words
=============

A text file containing 355k English words. 

While searching for a list of english words (for an auto-complete tutorial)
I found: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2213607/how-to-get-english-language-word-database which refers to http://www.infochimps.com/datasets/word-list-350000-simple-english-words-excel-readable 

No idea why infochimps put the word list inside an excel (.xls) file.

I pulled out the words into a simple new-line-delimited text file.
Which is more useful when building apps or importing into databases etc.

Copyright still belongs to them.

Files you may be interested in:

-  [words.txt](words.txt) contains all words.
-  [words_alpha.txt](words_alpha.txt) contains only [[:alpha:]] words. If you want a quick solution choose this.
